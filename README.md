# 🔍 Word Search Algorithms

This project implements **heuristic and metaheuristic search algorithms** to transform one word into another by replacing, adding, or removing letters.

## 📂 Project Structure
- 📝 **EX2_tamirleventer.py**: Python script implementing:
  - **A* Search**
  - **Hill Climbing**
  - **Simulated Annealing**
  - **Local Beam Search**
  - **Genetic Algorithm**
- 📄 **answers.pdf**: Explanations on heuristic functions, CSP problems, and algorithm efficiency.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python (with heapq, math, and random)**
- **Heuristic Search Methods**
- **Genetic Algorithms for Optimization**

## 🚀 How to Run
To execute the program:
```sh
python EX2_tamirleventer.py
